# Fuse - Social Media Project

Fuse is a social media platform that allows users to connect, share, and interact with each other. It is built using a combination of React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and other technologies. This README provides an overview of the project and its features.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Fuse uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and access protected routes.

- User Actions: Users can create, edit, like, and comment on posts. They can also follow and unfollow other users to see their latest updates.

- Notifications: Fuse integrates with the News API to fetch the latest news and provide personalized notifications to users based on their interests.

- Library Page: Fuse includes a library page that utilizes the Books API to showcase a collection of books or provide book recommendations to users.

- Real-time Chatting: Real-time chatting functionality is implemented using Socket.io, enabling users to engage in instant messaging with other users on the platform.

- UI Design: The user interface of Fuse is designed with a well-focused approach using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and intuitive experience for users.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the front-end development of Fuse.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment, used for the back-end development of Fuse.

- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side logic and API endpoints.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database, used for storing and managing the application's data.

- S3 Bucket: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used to store and serve static files such as images or other media.

- JSON Web Token (JWT): Used for user authentication and authorization.

- Socket.io: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server, used for implementing real-time chatting functionality.

## MVC Architecture

Fuse follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three components:

- Model: Responsible for managing the application's data and interacting with the database (MongoDB in this case).

- View: Handles the presentation layer, rendering the user interface and interacting with users.

- Controller: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, handling user requests, processing data, and updating the model or view accordingly.

This architectural pattern helps organize the codebase and maintain a clear separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

To run Fuse locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuse.git`
2. Install the dependencies for each interface: `npm install`
3. Set up the required environment variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).
4. Start the development server, client and socket: `npm run dev`
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`
